# Election Audit Overview
The purpose of this audit was to find the winner of the election based on the long list of data that was given to us. We used python code to read through all the data and extract all the votes for each candidate as well as all the votes from each county. With this information we can make a document that shows the winning candidate, and the county that casted the most votes.

# Election Audit Results
* There were a total of 369,711 votes casted
* Jefferson county casted 10.5% of the votes with 38,855 votes
* Denver county casted 82.8% of the votes with 306,055 votes
* Arapahoe county casted 6.7% of the votes with 24,801 votes
* Based on this info Denver county casted the most votes
* Charles C. Stockham had 23% of the votes with 85,213 votes
* Diana DeGette had 73.8% of the votes with 272,892 votes
* Raymon A. Doane had 3.1% of the votes with 11,606 votes
* Based on this info Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% (272,892) of the votes

# Election Audit Summary
This was a successful election audit that can provide even more success in the future. With how our code is structured we can run an infinte number of elections of any magnitude. If we were sent another sheet of election data all we would need to do is put that CSV file in the Resource folder and change our code to pull from the new file. We can easily change what column we need to be looking at to grab data. We can also easily create a new txt document in our analysis folder to write the data to all we have to change is the save.to command. With these examples our code can easily be used for future audits.
